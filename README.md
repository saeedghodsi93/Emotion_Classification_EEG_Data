# Classification of Human Emotions Using the EEG Data

In this project, I've designed and implemented a mathematical model for the classification of human emotions using EEG data. More specifically, data preprocessing has been performed based on the Independent Component Analysis method and a set of features including the Wavelet features, the Common Spatial Patterns, the powers of frequency bands, and the correlation between different bands have been extracted from the transformed data. A variety of models including the Support Vector Machines, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Random Decision Forests have finally been utilized for the classification purpose.
